- Mounting screws
- Do voltage sense according to AN2447
- Move in-line current sense resistors to top
- Move current sense ADC measurements away from ADC0/AREF as it prevents using internal 1.1V ref.  Add analog decoupling to AREF/AVCC
- Move battery JST connector so as not to interfere with MCU part
- ISP port with SMT pads for spring header
- Move button to a GPIO instead of RESET or add second button
- Rotate USB connector 90 deg to allow different mounting options
